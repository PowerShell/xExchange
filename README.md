### xExchAutoMountPoint

**xExchAutoMountPoint** is used to automatically find unused disks, and prepare them for use within AutoReseed. 
With the disks that are found, it will assign appropriate volume and database mount points. 
Once fully configured, if a disk fails and is replaced with a new disk, xExchAutoMountPoint will automatically detect it and format and assign an Exchange volume mount point so that AutoReseed can detect it as a spare disk. 

* **Identity**: The name of the server. 
This is not actually used for anything.
* **AutoDagDatabasesRootFolderPath**: The parent folder for Exchange database mount point folders.
* **AutoDagVolumesRootFolderPath**: The parent folder for Exchange volume mount point folders.
* **DiskToDBMap**: An array of strings containing the databases for each disk. 
Databases on the same disk should be in the same string, and comma separated. 
Example: "DB1,DB2","DB3,DB4". 
This puts DB1 and DB2 on one disk, and DB3 and DB4 on another.
* **SpareVolumeCount**: How many spare volumes will be available.
* **CreateSubfolders**: Defaults to $false. 
If $true, specifies that DBNAME.db and DBNAME.log subfolders should be automatically created underneath the ExchangeDatabase mount points.
* **FileSystem**: The file system to use when formatting the volume. 
Defaults to NTFS.
* **MinDiskSize**: The minimum size of a disk to consider using. 
Defaults to none.

Defaults to GPT.
* **UnitSize**: The unit size to use when formatting the disk. 
Defaults to 64k.
* **VolumePrefix**: The prefix to give to Exchange Volume folders. 
Defaults to EXVOL

#### Common Issues
xExchAutoMountPoint will not assign an Exchange database mount point if the target folder for the database already exists. 
If initial setup fails, make sure that the database folders do not already exist. 
Note that this only affects database folders. 
If a volume folder already exists, the resource will just find the next unused number and assign it to a new volume folder.

* **Credential**: The credentials to use to perform the installation.

### xExchJetstress

**xExchJetstress** automatically runs Jetstress using the **JetstressCmd.exe** command line executable. 
The resource launches Jetstress via a Scheduled Task, then monitors for JetstressCmd.exe to determine whether Jetstress is running. 
Once JetstressCmd.exe has finished, xExchJetstress looks for the existence of **TYPE*.html** files in the Jetstress installation directory to determine whether Jetstress has already been run, or if it needs to be executed. 
**TYPE** corresponds to the Type defined in the **JetstressConfig.xml** file, where valid values are **Performance**, **Stress**, **DatabaseBackup**, or **SoftRecovery**. 
If TYPE*.html files exist, the newest file is inspected to determine whether the Jetstress run resulted in a **Pass** or **Fail**. 
Note that a **TYPE*.html** file is not written until Jetstress has finished its initialization phase, and has also finished the testing phase with either a **Pass** or a **Fail**. 
A crash of the JetstressCmd.exe process will also prevent the file from being written.

* **Type**: Specifies the Type which was defined in the JetstressConfig.xml file: { Performance | Stress | DatabaseBackup | SoftRecovery }
* **JetstressPath**: The path to the folder where Jetstress is installed, and which contains JetstressCmd.exe.
* **JetstressParams**: Command line parameters to pass into JetstressCmd.exe.
* **MaxWaitMinutes**: The maximum amount of time that the Scheduled Task which runs Jetstress can execute for. 
Defaults to 0, which means there is no time limit.
* **MinAchievedIOPS**: The minimum value reported in the 'Achieved Transactional I/O per Second' section of the Jetstress report for the run to be considered successful. 
Defaults to 0. 
    - **WARNING 1:** Jetstress should **NEVER** be run on a server that already has Exchange installed. 
    Jetstress is only meant to be used for pre-installation server validation.
    As such, it is recommended that **xExchJetstress** be used in a one time script which is separate from the script that performs ongoing server configuration validation.
    - **WARNING 2:** **xExchJetstress** should **NOT** be used in the same configuration script as **xExchJetstressCleanup**. 
    Instead, they should be run in separate scripts.
    Because **xExchJetstress** looks for files and folders that may have been cleaned up by **xExchJetstressCleanup**, using them in the same script may result in a configuration loop.

### xExchJetstressCleanup 

xExchJetstressCleanup cleans up the database and log directories created by Jetstress. 
It can optionally remove mount points associated with those directories, and can also remove the Jetstress binaries. 
Note that **xExchJetstressCleanup** does **NOT** uninstall Jetstress. 
That can be accomplished using the **Package** resource which is built into DSC.

* **JetstressPath**: The path to the folder where Jetstress is installed, which contains **JetstressCmd.exe**.
* ***ConfigFilePath**: The full path to **JetstressConfig.xml**, which will be used to determine the database and log folders that need to be removed.
* ***DatabasePaths**: Specifies the paths to database directories that should be cleaned up.
* **DeleteAssociatedMountPoints**: Indicates that the mount points associated with the Jetstress database and log paths should be removed. 
Defaults to $false. 
Does not remove EXVOL mount points.
* ***LogPaths**: Specifies the paths to log directories that should be cleaned up.
* **RemoveBinaries**: Specifies that the files located in **JetstressPath** should be removed. 
If **ConfigFilePath** is also specified and JetstressConfig.xml is in the same directory as JetstressPath, all files will be removed from the directory except JetstressConfig.xml.
* **OutputSaveLocation**: If **RemoveBinaries** is set to $true and Jetstress output was saved to the default location (**JetstressPath**), this specifies the folder path to copy the Jetstress output files to. 

Note: Either **ConfigFilePath**, or **DatabasePaths** AND **LogPaths** MUST be specified. **ConfigFilePath** takes precedence over **DatabasePaths** and **LogPaths**.

**WARNING:** **xExchJetstress** should NOT be used in the same configuration script as **xExchJetstressCleanup**. 
Instead, they should be run in separate scripts. 
Because **xExchJetstress** looks for files and folders that may have been cleaned up by **xExchJetstressCleanup**, using them in the same script may result in a configuration loop.
